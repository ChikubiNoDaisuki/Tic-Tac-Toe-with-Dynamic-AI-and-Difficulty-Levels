# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-Dynamic-AI-and-Difficulty-Levels
This Python code creates a Tic Tac Toe game with a Tkinter GUI. Players choose 'X' or 'O' and set AI difficulty (Easy or Hard). The AI uses the Minimax algorithm for optimal moves, with advanced alpha-beta pruning for harder levels. It includes functions for gameplay, checking outcomes, and resetting the board.
